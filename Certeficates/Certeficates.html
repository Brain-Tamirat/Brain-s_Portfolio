        The crazy story about this certification program was that I took it
        through Telegram funny. Over all the program was all about the Gig-Economy. <br><br>
        In the first module it was all about What Gig-Economy Is, second one was about how Gigs work,
        and so on. It was free and if you want to take it your self here touch the link below.

        This was my first Certificate that I took this past September.
        It was the beginning of my journy to be come a full stack developer. <br><br>
        It has three parts basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript including DOM manipulation.
        A funfact It was inteded to be taken in 2 months but I just took it in 3 weaks.

        A glimpse of the Android world/app devs. It was nice to take
        this course cause I knew little knowledge about app development for
        android. <br><br> Mostly it was all about how the app set up works we
        didn't dive deeper on what happens on the back (Java/Kotlin). But the good
        thing was I have understood basic component if someday am gone create my own
        app it will be handy.

        After i took this Course i have entered to another dimension this course is so good
        that i learn to many things from it. its free and readily available online. <br><br>
        Learning never seem this easy. The fun fact i like about this course is it has no videos
        or any modules but codes and codes with little guidence only. It is the best to get a top notch skill you want.
