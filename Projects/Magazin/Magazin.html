          Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning.
          Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through
          building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let
          me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6
          certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are
          only changing the optional coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
          After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve
          them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a
          revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is
          what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor! It wasn't as
          dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred
          to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire
          curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual
          coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own
          seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information
          to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that
          isn't enough.)

        <p class="third-paragraph">
          No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one
          test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of
          passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own
          understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between
          lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into
          projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain
          everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty
          of repetition.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph">
          The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of
          explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test
          description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this.
          People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and
          forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode". Instead of a series of
          coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one
          test after another, quickly building up a project. People will get
          into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they
          build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll
          get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And
          freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

          <ul class="the-lists">
            <li class="list sub-title">V1 - 2014</li>
            <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.</p>
            <li class="list sub-title">V2 - 2015</li>
            <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            <li class="list sub-title">V3 - 2015</li>
            <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
            <li class="list sub-title">V4 - 2016</li>
            <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
            <li class="list sub-title">V5 - 2017</li>
            <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            <li class="list sub-title">V6 - 2018</li>
            <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.</p>
